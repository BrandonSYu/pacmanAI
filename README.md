# pacmanAI
A pacman AI project following UC Berkeley's CS188 AI course

Project is built to explore fundamental AI concepts such as informed state-space search, probalistic inference, and reinforcement learning.	

Various multi-agent searches are used like A*, minimax, expectimax with alpha-beta pruning.

Project requires Python2.7.

Enter `python pacman.py -h`for a list of options like 

`python pacman.py --layout testMaze --pacman GoWestAgent` 

Further directions can be found in Project pdf.

I also included a documentation of the results of each search with various options set.
